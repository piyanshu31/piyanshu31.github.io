# 👋 Hey, I'm Piyanshu

I'm an engineering student from Akola, India, passionate about **systems, logic, and real-world problem solving**. Whether it's diving deep into **Operating Systems**, experimenting with **Machine Learning**, or building automation tools in **Python**, I’m always chasing that next breakthrough moment.

Inspired by the strategic mindset of *Isagi (Blue Lock)* and the action mechanics of *Shadow Fight 2*, I treat every project like a new level — **an opportunity to grow, optimize, and adapt**.

---

## 🧠 What Drives Me

- **Strategic Curiosity:** I learn like I’m preparing for a final move — deep, focused, and tactical.
- **Hands-on Learning:** I prefer building over browsing. Notes, simulations, and prototypes are my favorite teachers.
- **Code as a Tool, Not Just a Skill:** I code to understand systems, not just solve problems.

---

## 🛠️ Currently Exploring

- **C, C++, Python** — mastering the fundamentals
- **Machine Learning** — building real-world models (LASSO, Polynomial Regression)
- **OCR Pipelines** — using Tesseract, CRNN, and CV techniques
- **Operating Systems & CN** — via notes and lab-style simulations
- **Automation Projects** — resume screener, job notifier, and more

---

## 📈 Projects That Reflect Me

- 🧾 **OCR Extractor:** Converts images and PDFs into clean, structured text  
- 🔋 **Temperature vs Power Model:** Predictive ML using non-linear regression  
- 🤖 **Resume Screener (Planned):** Matching resumes to job roles using NLP  
- 🕸️ **Job Notifier (Planned):** Scrapes listings, notifies users, automates updates  
- 📚 **Teaching Tools:** OS & Networking notes with real-time demos

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Goals

- Build an **AI-based Portfolio of Automation Tools**
- Create a **Shadow Fight 2-inspired Game Engine**
- Prepare thoroughly for **GATE (CSE)** and contribute to open-source learning resources

---

## 🔄 Philosophy

> *"Consistency over motivation. Adaptability over routine. Think like a strategist, build like an engineer."*
